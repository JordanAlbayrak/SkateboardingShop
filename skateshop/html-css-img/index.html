                    Hi all, I want to use the "Student Success Week" in a creative way - so that it actually will help you in your progression.
                    I think the thing you need MOST time on is your game project (I really want it to be a GOOD game at the end).
                    So I will allow you to work on this for this week and we will use the class time for help with your projects, if you need it.
                    I'll be online at the class times - and if you need help just pass by and ask your technical or design questions for the game.
                    So class is not mandatory these 2 classes but I will be available.
                    Also, I did say I'd accept one lab late - with a penalty.  So if you have any labs you need to catch up on , you can send it in.
                    You would have to notify me via Mio if you decide to do this.
